## Introduction

### Account Registration & Access
#### Register
![](docs/images/General/Register.png)

Register your account with your 7-digit school ID. After being registered, you will be redirected to the login page and your login code will be sent to your email.

#### Login
![](docs/images/General/Login.png)

If you don't already have your current login code, enter your ID under __Get a Login Code__ and click _Email Code_.

To login, enter your ID and current login code.

__Note:__ Each login code is a random 6-digit uppercase hexadecimal number.

### Your Account
![](docs/images/Your_Account/Your_Account.png)

#### Account Information
![](docs/images/Your_Account/Update_Account_Information.png)

This page displays the user's current account information. Students may update each section at a time. The information in red is only editable by officers and admins.

#### Competition Selections
![](docs/images/Your_Account/Compeition_Selections.png)

This page allows competitors to "opt-in" (select) which competitions they would like to attend and their current registration, payment, form, bus, and room status. Once a student selects to go to a competition, they will appear in the competition's selection report (explained later).

__Note:__ Just because a student selects to go to a competition does not mean they will. An officer must approve their selection by registering them to the competition (explained later).

#### Transactions
![](docs/images/Your_Account/Transactions.png)

All current transactions, outstanding or otherwise, are shown here. The red in the __Total Owed__ column indicates that money is owed by the account and green indicates that money is owed to the account.

The _Archive_ button moves a transaction to a separate `table` to keep receipts of all transactions made.

__Note:__ The __Actions__ column is only viewable and usable by officers and admins. The __Add Transaction(s)__ button will be explained later. Each transaction has a log that records all update made to a transaction and is only viewable by the admin (shown later).


### Officer Management

The red fields mentioned before in a student's __Update Account Information__ page can be edited by officers and admins.

![](docs/images/Officer_Management/Add_Transactions.png)

By clicking the "Add Transaction(s)" button mentioned before, a popup windows will appear that will allow an officer or admin add another transaction such as a club sweater.

__Note:__ In the event that a transaction may require additional information such as a shirt size (if the purchased size is different that the one found in the student's account info) or receipt number, the transaction's __Modifier__ box may be used.
